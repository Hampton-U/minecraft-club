# Hampton University Minecraft Club

Welcome to the Hampton University Minecraft Club. This club meets weekly to learn how to modify the
popular [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) game.

There are many options for running a modified Minecraft server. For our club we are going to focus
on using the [Paper](https://docs.papermc.io/) system.

## Getting Started

In order to create a modfied Minecraft server you need to download a few pieces of software:

  1. *Java*. Be sure to install the [appropriate Java version](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started#requirements).
  2. *Paper*. Download the [laatest version of Paper](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper).
  3. *Minecraft Java*. You'll need a [Minecraft Java client](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc). This is the only non-free and open software. It is necessary to actually play the game and interact with your mods.
